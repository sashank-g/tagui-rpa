Krishna Sir PS2: Avigyan or Shashank

when you are free (only when you are free and itching to do some interesting hack) try to explore these tools 

--> http://robotjs.io/ or https://tagui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

using above tools you can write a script to open a browser, website, enter some details and click a button.

You can see one example here https://github.com/kelaberetiv/TagUI/blob/master/flows/samples/1_google.tag
this will search for a keyword in google and take the screenshot.

--> https://rapidapi.com/blog/lp/microsoft-ocr/

this api will convert the image into text.

Using above two tools I want to come up with a script to login into this website with user name, password & captcha, go to dashboard, enter some details and submit a button.
